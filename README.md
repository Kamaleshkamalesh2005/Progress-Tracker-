## Add the screenshots (how to download and add images)

Follow these steps to add the screenshots you provided (images 1–4) and a tools image into the repository so that the README will display them correctly.

1. Create the folders in your repo (from repository root):
   - mkdir -p assets/screenshots

2. Save the images (two ways depending on where they are currently available):

   A. If the images are visible in your browser or this chat view:
   - Right-click each image → "Save image as..." and save them with the filenames below:
     - assets/tools.png            (tools picture)
     - assets/screenshots/signup.png
     - assets/screenshots/signin.png
     - assets/screenshots/teacher_dashboard.png
     - assets/screenshots/admin_dashboard.png

   B. If you have direct URLs to the uploaded images, use curl or wget:
   - curl -L -o assets/tools.png "https://example.com/path/to/tools.png"
   - curl -L -o assets/screenshots/signup.png "https://example.com/path/to/signup.png"
   - curl -L -o assets/screenshots/signin.png "https://example.com/path/to/signin.png"
   - curl -L -o assets/screenshots/teacher_dashboard.png "https://example.com/path/to/teacher_dashboard.png"
   - curl -L -o assets/screenshots/admin_dashboard.png "https://example.com/path/to/admin_dashboard.png"

   Replace `https://example.com/...` with the actual image URLs.

3. Verify the images exist:
   - ls -la assets assets/screenshots

4. Stage and commit the images to the repo:
   - git add assets/tools.png assets/screenshots/*
   - git commit -m "chore: add screenshots and tools image for README"
   - git push origin main

   Note: Use your actual branch name instead of `main` if different.

5. Confirm the README displays the images on GitHub by viewing the repository.

Optional: If your images are large, consider using Git LFS before adding them:
- git lfs install
- git lfs track "assets/screenshots/*"
- git add .gitattributes
- then add images as above.
